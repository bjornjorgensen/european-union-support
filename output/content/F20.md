F20 is about modifications to the *contract* or *concession*.

Similar to [F14](../F14), the European Commission in its [eForms consultation](https://github.com/eForms/eForms) proposes to republish notices – adding a short section to summarize and justify the modification – instead of using F20 ([see discussion](https://github.com/eForms/eForms/issues/45)).

<!--
As described in [this discussion](https://github.com/eForms/eForms/issues/306), a modification notice informs about the *modification*, not about the object as a whole. For example, it can inform about: a new place of performance, without restating all places of performance; the duration of the modification, without updating the duration of the contract; the CPV code for an antenna, without restating the CPV code for the vehicle.
-->

## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations#create-a-release) and:

1. Add 'awardUpdate' and 'contractUpdate' to `tag`.

## What's new

If you have already implemented all prior forms, this notice adds:

* [IV.2.1](#IV.2.1) Contract award notice concerning this contract
* [VII](#VII) Modifications to the contract/concession
