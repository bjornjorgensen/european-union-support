**Quick links:** [PDF form](http://simap.ted.europa.eu/documents/10184/99173/EN_F20.pdf) | [sample XML](https://github.com/open-contracting/european-union-support/blob/master/output/samples/F20_2014.xml)

F20 is about modifications to the *contract* or *concession*.

Similar to [F14](../F14), the European Commission in its [eForms consultation](https://github.com/eForms/eForms) proposes to republish notices – adding a short section to summarize and justify the modification – instead of using F20 ([see discussion](https://github.com/eForms/eForms/issues/45)).

<!--
As described in [this discussion](https://github.com/eForms/eForms/issues/306), a modification notice informs about the *modification*, not about the object as a whole. For example, it can inform about: a new place of performance, without restating all places of performance; the duration of the modification, without updating the duration of the contract; the CPV code for an antenna, without restating the CPV code for the vehicle.

## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations#create-a-release) and:

1. Add 'awardUpdate' and 'contractUpdate' to `tag`.

## What's new

If you have already implemented all prior forms, this notice adds:

* [IV.2.1](#IV.2.1) Contract award notice concerning this contract
* [VII](#VII) Modifications to the contract/concession

Unlike other forms, F20 always discards `/PROCEDURE/NOTICE_NUMBER_OJ` (*Contract award notice concerning this contract*), since it always refers to a contract award notice. See how to (reference a previous publication)[../operations#reference-a-previous-publication] for details.

Unlike [F03](../F03) and [F06](../F06), F20 discards `/AWARD_CONTRACT/AWARDED_CONTRACT/VALUES` (V.2.4 *Information on value of the contract/lot/concession*), since it will have been disclosed in an F03 or F06, and since F20 maps `/MODIFICATIONS_CONTRACT/DESCRIPTION_PROCUREMENT/VALUES` (VII.1.6 *Information on value of the contract/lot/concession*) to the same OCDS fields.
