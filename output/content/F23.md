## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations/#create-a-release).

## What's new

If you have already implemented all prior forms, this notice adds:

* [Preamble](#preamble)
* Fields to [IV.1.1](#IV.1.1) Form of procedure
* Fields to [V.2.4](#V.2.4) Information on value of the concession and main financing terms
* [Annex D4](#annex-d4-concession) Concession

Unlike [F03](../F03) and [F06](../F06), F23 has no `/AWARD_CONTRACT/CONTRACT_NO` (*Contract No*). As such, the mapping to the award's `.id` is described in [`/AWARD_CONTRACT`](#/AWARD_CONTRACT) (*Award of concession*).

In the PDF, unlike [F15](../F15), F23 has no index for `/AWARD_CONTRACT/AWARDED_CONTRACT` and no label for `AWARD_CONTRACT/AWARDED_CONTRACT/CONTRACTORS`.
