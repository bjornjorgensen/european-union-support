## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations/#create-a-release) and:

1. Add 'award' and 'contract' to `tag`.
1. Set `tender.status` to 'complete'.

## What's new

If you have already implemented all prior forms, this notice adds:

* [II.4](#II.4) Essential assets
* Fields to [III](#III) Legal, economic, financial and technical information
* [V.2.3](#V.2.3) Indications about ownership of the selected operator
* [V.2.3](#V.2.3) Name and address of the party or parties exercising legal control over the selected operator
* [V.2.4](#V.2.4) Kilometres of public passenger transport services

Unlike [F03](F03) and [F06](F06), T02 has no `/AWARD_CONTRACT/CONTRACT_NO` (*Contract No*). As such, the mapping to the award's `.id` is described in [`/AWARD_CONTRACT`](#/AWARD_CONTRACT) (*Award of contract*).
