## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations#create-a-release) for each `/OBJECT_CONTRACT` (*Object*) element.

If the notice is a periodic indicative notice only, then the `/OBJECT_CONTRACT` (*Object*) element is repeatable. The release corresponding to each element will have a different `ocid`.

## What's new

If you have already implemented all prior forms, this notice adds:

* [I.6](#I.6) Main activity
* [III.1.4](#III.1.4) Objective rules and criteria for participation
* Fields to [IV.1.1](#IV.1.1) Type of procedure
