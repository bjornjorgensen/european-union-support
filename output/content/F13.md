## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../../operations/#create-a-release) and:

1. Add 'award' to `tag`.
1. If the notice has a `/RESULTS/AWARDED_PRIZE` (*Award and prizes*) element, set `tender.status` to 'complete'. Otherwise, if the notice has a `/RESULTS/NO_AWARDED_PRIZE/PROCUREMENT_UNSUCCESSFUL` (*No plans or projects were received or all were rejected*) element, set `tender.status` to 'unsuccessful'. Otherwise, set `tender.status` to 'cancelled'.

## What's new

If you have already implemented all prior forms, this notice adds:

* [V.3](#V.3) Award and prizes

## Other notes

The PDF form has radio buttons for the legal basis, which correspond to a single unlabeled XML element (`/LEGAL_BASIS`).
